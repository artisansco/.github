# 🏗️ Organization Tech Stack

This outlines the core and experimental technologies we use to build, deploy, and maintain our software systems across web, mobile, and backend services.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

We prioritize simplicity, performance, and developer ergonomics. Our stack is selected to support fast iteration, strong typing, cross-platform support, and high performance for both end-users and developers.

## 🚀 Core Tech Stack

### 🖥️ Backend
- **[Go (Golang)](https://golang.org/):** Primary language for backend services, chosen for its speed, concurrency model, and simplicity.
- **[Hono](https://hono.dev/):** Minimal, ultra-fast web framework for building REST APIs and lightweight services in Go.

### 🌐 Web Frontend
- **[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/):** Framework for building fast, interactive, and server-rendered web applications with zero-boilerplate DX.

### 📱 Mobile
- **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/):** Cross-platform mobile app framework with a single codebase for Android and iOS, delivering native performance and expressive UIs.

## 🧪 Experimental & Systems-Level Technologies

While not used in production yet, the following technologies are explored for prototyping and performance-critical tasks:

- **[Zig](https://ziglang.org/):** Low-level systems language known for safety, performance, and interoperability with C.
- **[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)):** For direct hardware manipulation, legacy integration, and performance benchmarking.
- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/):** Memory-safe systems language considered for high-performance backend tools and WebAssembly targets.
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/):** Simple language considered for fast iteration and prototyping.
